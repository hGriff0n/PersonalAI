Short Term:
  Get 'quit' to work (wit isn't recognizing it properly)
    The dispatch app and the server keep running way too long
      There's an issue with the quit dispatch getting thrown around too casually
    I think the server has no conception of "shutting down" yet
  Find a way to press ctrl-c in cli app and have it raise in parent app

Produce a short video of the project

Medium Term:
  Move file location to the server
    Convert music selection to using the server data
    Move out of hardcoding the music files

Long Term:
  Figure out how the device manager is supposed to act if I add in an AI node
    I suppose in the final system, the AI node gets setup first, so the server addr exists
    We can also use the udp broadcast system to handle this possibility
      Would need to modify the launcher script to wait until the manager has found the server
  Switch over networking to use udp broadcasting to determine where the servers are
    I'm hardcoding the locations for now as that is simpler for my initial development
