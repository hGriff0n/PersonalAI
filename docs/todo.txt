Short Term:
  Fix the issues with quit/stop behavior (Seem to have brought everything to a halt)
    Have wit recognize 'quit' and 'stop'
      Remove the hardcoding of these commands within the apps?
        May not be possible as the apps would get stuck in the next iteration
    Might want to swap out for LUIS (or even roll my own solution)
  Enable a system to allow for data to be passed through the device-manager without being used
    Might want to have a "special" app that I can use to control the server directly
    Fix the device-manager refusing to stop running
  Find a way to press ctrl-c in cli app and have it raise in parent app

Produce a short video of the project

Medium Term:
  Vastly improve the available music files
    Look at fselect for producing the file list
      It's not developed as a library perse though
      The idea for this is that the dispatch app would request the manager to select a file
        The manager would then forward that file on to the audio app
        TODO: See if I can't come up with a better procedure
      Idea 2: The server provides a set of "services" (API) that utilities can use
        This "File search" is one of them: Give the query json, get the file path
        The dispatch app queries the server for this path and sends the response to the audio app
  It would be nice if the server could spawn up "One-time use" plugins as needed
    Need to figure out a way to integrate the plugin architecture across AI/device/etc. plugins
  Improve the handshaking procedure to actually have some degree of security and utility
    Current system only works because I have everything hardcoded

Long Term:
  Look at splitting system to automatically create ai node by default
    This would allow for keeping the device manager to simple behavior
    Also simplifies the procedure for interacting with multi-device systems
  Figure out how the device manager is supposed to act if I add in an AI node
    I suppose in the final system, the AI node gets setup first, so the server addr exists
    We can also use the udp broadcast system to handle this possibility
      Would need to modify the launcher script to wait until the manager has found the server
  Switch over networking to use udp broadcasting to determine where the servers are
    I'm hardcoding the locations for now as that is simpler for my initial development
