Planning Document

Steps:
  Get speech.py working (I think the fact that the laptop is closed is stopping the mic)
    NOTE: Since SR produces text, I can just hardcode what I "say" to develop the next part
      Feed the sentence into the next stage, once I get a mic, I can actually speak it

Initial Goal:
  Be able to open a program on my computer using voice (using custom AI)
  Be able to ask my computer the weather using my voice
  Control Spotify using voice only (this will actually be somewhat difficult)

Broad Planning:
  Sort of want an Alexa/Cortana style system across all of my devices
    Help with planning/reminders/etc.
    Unify all of my devices under a central planning system (smart home/computers/etc.)
  One neat thing would be to send "documents" across devices
    "Send this to my laptop" and then current focus of the desktop will open on the laptop at the next time
  Going to want it to be very extensible
    Say I get a smart lock
    I want to be able to plug it in, say "lock the door" and have the door lock
  How conversational do I want it to be?
    At the beginning it may not be that conversational (but the technology will improve a lot)

Broad Description:
  Unified computer organization and interaction system
  Open and work on a file on one computer, then finish and close it on another
  Completely interactable with an Alexa style voice interface and artificial intelligence
