Short Term:
  Hook up dispatch plugin and get system communication working
    Need to get to the point where I can play a song from the cli app
  Create script to start up everything to baseline level
  Develop config system and integrate it
  Improve logging support
  Improve code quality
    Improve performance (playing the music took way too long)

Long Term:
  Switch over networking to use udp broadcasting to determine where the servers are
    I'm hardcoding the locations for now as that is simpler for my initial development
