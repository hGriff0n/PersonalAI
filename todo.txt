Short Term:
  Closing the scripts needs to stop the audio from playing
    Audio needs to stop sending a beep every second
      Check that it's not recognizing the AC
  Create script to start up everything to baseline level
    Remove the need to hardcode the plugin directory
      This means adding arguments to plugins/etc. to take a base directory (gotten from config)
  Adapt rust server to start taking arguments through the command line
    I'm using clap-rs to produce the argument parser
      Look at including the yaml dependency too (https://docs.rs/clap/2.31.2/clap/)
      This would enable me to put the parser code into the same spot for rust and python
        Python version: https://github.com/fmenabe/python-clg
        NOTE: I want to produce valid args, not parse them (but I do for the plugins)
  Improve logging support
    Convert rust output to use logging instead
    Split logging for plugins into separate files
      The 'loader' stuff should not log to the plugin files
    Log any received config options that are not used/recognized
  Improve code quality
    Improve performance (playing the music takes way too long)
    Fix various bugs and irregularities in the various plugins
    Harden up dispatch for unexpected inputs
    Improve the pathing for the configuration files
      Streamline the paths so they are always based on a common root
      Then add in adjustment code to transform the relative paths for the app
        In case the root path is not considered as such during app running

Long Term:
  Switch over networking to use udp broadcasting to determine where the servers are
    I'm hardcoding the locations for now as that is simpler for my initial development
