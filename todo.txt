Short Term:
  Get system communication working in a more ad-hoc way
    I need to make sure the audio app doesn't "speak" any ACK messages
      More broadly, don't say `ACK` when the results are shown through you
      Be sure to send 'ACK' portions to the sending app (split if different)
  Create script to start up everything to baseline level
    Utilize config system to determine what apps to start up
      Develop config system and integrate it
    Run the cli app "inline" if it is loaded (ie. transition into cli)
  Improve logging support
    Add logging to the rust server
  Improve code quality
    Improve performance (playing the music took way too long)

Long Term:
  Switch over networking to use udp broadcasting to determine where the servers are
    I'm hardcoding the locations for now as that is simpler for my initial development
