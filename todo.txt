Short Term:
  Get system communication working in a more ad-hoc way
    Closing the scripts needs to stop the audio from playing
  Create script to start up everything to baseline level
    Utilize config system to determine what apps to start up
      Develop config system and integrate it
      Might be able to remove config system integration from individual apps then
    Run the cli app "inline" if it is loaded (ie. transition into cli)
      Only works if the rust server has actual logging support
      Make sure that everything works even if the cli is not run
    Remove the need to hardcode the plugin directory
  Improve logging support
    Add logging to the rust server
  Improve code quality
    Improve performance (playing the music takes way too long)
    Fix various bugs and irregularities in the various plugins
    Harden up dispatch for unexpected inputs

Long Term:
  Switch over networking to use udp broadcasting to determine where the servers are
    I'm hardcoding the locations for now as that is simpler for my initial development
